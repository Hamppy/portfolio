        Virgin Oil Co. took a first step for visual refreshment during the summer 2013. This traditional italian american restaurant in the centre of Helsinki was opened back in 2010 so the time was right for some adjustments. A new marketing strategy according to certain customer profiles was drawn up and original visual identity decomposed for analysis. The name Virgin Oil Co. is an imaginary title for a fictive olive oil importer located in New York during 1920â€™ies. The location, decade and theme itself were retained, but aesthetically refined for more sophisticated and simplified look. Naturally the table menu was the first utensil to be updated.
