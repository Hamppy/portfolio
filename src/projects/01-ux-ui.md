        The original WordPress development version of Integral home page was for some reason pretty poorly mobile optimised and the overall appearance had no stimulants in order to get the users engaged. Also the possibilities of content updating for non technical operators were practically negligible. We made a fundamental deep dive in to the existing site structure in order to solve if we could somehow maintain the most of it while implementing a page building tool – that turned out to be a success and pretty soon we were ready to start developing content based on Growth Driven Design methodology…

        As a part of the largest ticket sales company in Europe Lippupiste Oy sells event, concert and theatre tickets via the largest online store (https://www.lippu.fi ») in Finland. The sales and marketing department at Lippupiste made an initiative to clarify event arrangement and ticket sales process with the help of a detached site targeted specifically for domestic event promoters. In this case Drupal CMS was the most obvious choice for the customer side since the platform itself was familiar for the operators at marketing.
        
        A dedicated ‘NEWS’ minisite for domestic users listing current topics and latest changes over various upcoming events promoted through Lippupiste. Practically serves as a gallery like user surface where all entries can be maintained in a step more orderly fashion than on Facebook for example.

        The content management system of hotelzon.com site needed to be updated and during this procedure the layout as well as the content itself were refreshed in order to achieve more compelling user journey and optimal mobile performance. WordPress was an obvious choice out of the different alternatives available and the experts from Roger Customer Experience Studio brought along their extensive experience over WordPress development and implementation. The outcome now has wider possibilities from the content production point of view and also improved tracking features for system integration.
